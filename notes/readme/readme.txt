HEY ALL

so the enemy spawner was supposed to be here...

why isn't it? well, gmker screwed up and deleted random crap. BUT the script for spawning still exists. SO USE THAT!

ALSO, all prior code was written by 13yo me, so yeah thats crazy.
linux and macos releases were planned...
ALSO, the game will crash upon running, due to removal of the camera object here. The camera was a paid script, so i removed it here. 
though purchasing it and dropping it here should fix it! thanks for understandin' ..・ヾ(。＞＜)シ https://marketplace.gamemaker.io/assets/8569/ultimate-camera
